# bids-mriqc
Gear that runs the MRIQC pipeline on BIDS-curated data.

MRIQC calculates [Image Quality Metrics (IQMs)](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/measures.html#module-mriqc.qc) and saves them in a JSON file under the <output-dir>/derivatives/ folder.

This runs at the session (participant) level.
